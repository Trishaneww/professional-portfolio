# professional-portfolio


## Overview
It is crucial to have a deployed professiional portfolio in order to showcase my applications and projects to future employers. Using my current skills in HTML and CSS, I have created and deployed a live webpage that both showcases my website development skills, but also showcases my projects to employers.

## Features
The codebase has an abundance of features as stated below:
- Uses flexbox elements to obtain a fully responsive webpage, compatible with a large range of screen dimensions
- Has subtle transitions when the user interacts with the buttons on screen
- Clicking any of the three options in the navigation bar will direct the user to the corrosponding section of the webpage
- Contains "alt" phrases with descriptive titles of each image displayed, for screen readers
